## About Application

With Air-Quality, you can get air quality directly from the cities of your choice.

To add the city or cities of your choice to the starting selection, you just need to create an account. You will have access to the admin page from which you can search for your city.

Then, if your city is listed by the API, it will be added to the list of cities.

The application will then give you the air quality index of these cities with a clear and simple color code corresponding to this index.
